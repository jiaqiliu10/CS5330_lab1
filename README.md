In our code, for the Performance Metric section, We used brightness difference calculation. The logic is to compare the average brightness values of the original image and the generated ASCII art image, then compute the difference between them. The smaller the value, the closer the brightness of the ASCII image is to the original image; the larger the value, the more noticeable the difference.
